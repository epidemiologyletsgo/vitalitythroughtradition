            <p>Hello! My name is Rebecca LaRuffa, and I’m the President and Founder of this club as well as a Psychology major. I started this club because, after training for about two years, I discovered that working out became an incredible outlet for me—a way to find balance, strength, and focus. <br> <br>I wanted to share that experience with the Carolina community while also celebrating and promoting Asian traditions that inspire many of these practices. My goal is to create a welcoming and supportive space where members can connect, grow, and build awareness of Asian culture while gaining strength here at Carolina.</p>
